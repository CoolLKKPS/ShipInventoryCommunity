# Ship Inventory Updated
Adds a ship object that allows players to safely store items inside the ship's inventory.

### Vent Chute
By holding an item to the vent chute, you can put items into the ship's inventory. You can also retrieve them using the terminal.

### Command
To access the ship's inventory, you need to type `ship` into the terminal. A window will show up, showing you every option available for the mod.

### Configs
This mod tries to give a lot of control to the user. There are a lot of configurations so that you can enjoy the mod as you want. If you want a deeper look into the available settings, you can take a look at [this documentation](https://github.com/WarperSan/ShipInventory/blob/master/SETTINGS.md), which goes over every setting and explains each one.

### Save and Load
This mod is compatible with saving and loading the game. The inventory is stored in the save file itself. 

*Note:*\
This mod uses the default method of saving items. If you remove or add mods that add items, the save file might be corrupted.

### Language support
This mod supports different languages. To add or create a new language, simply copy the `lang-en.json` file and replace the values. The file has to be in the same folder as the mod itself.

### About
This mod was originally created for 2 reasons:
1. One of my friends kept throwing scrap off the ship, making us lose.
2. I got lag spikes when around the ship (which I assumed is because of the items).
